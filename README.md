# do the work or DO THE WORK!

> This is not just an idea its a mindset-shift; "do the work" - how sure are you that you're not doing grunt work and calling it work? or DO THE WORK! - do it right so you don't have to repeat yourself
>
>  The below will serve as a guide on how the following implementations can be done the demo application showing these applications will be a TODOs List App

1. WHY (#why)
2. Make things work for you (#solution1)
3. Develop a templating engine (#solution2)
4. Develop the app with the user (#solution3)

## 1. WHY

The traditional way of development requires you to follow a step by step guide or do things in a way that MAY seem redundant, boring or even make development boring!

The below should give you a little more context

## 2. HACK: Make things work for you

This implementation relies on your resourcefulness as a develop: Consider defining your database/models so well you no longer have to rewrite forms/layouts

## 3. Develop a templating engine for your application

Another more defined and reliable way to developing software

## 4. Let the client/user do the work and you only if YOU NEED TO

This idea explores another way to ensure you can mitigate the amount of work you are doing is by allowing the client to alter/edit the application as easy as possible
